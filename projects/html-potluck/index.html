        <p> 
            In this anime feature, 13-year-old Kiki 
            moves to a seaside town with her talking 
            cat, Jiji, to spend a year alone, in 
            accordance with her village's tradition 
            for witches in training. After learning 
            to control her broomstick, Kiki sets up 
            a flying courier service and soon becomes 
            a fixture in the community. But when the 
            insecure young witch begins questioning 
            herself and loses her magic abilities, 
            she must overcome her self-doubt to get 
            her powers back.

            In this animated feature by noted Japanese director

                <p>
                    During a forbidden excursion to see the 
                    surface world, a goldfish princess encounters 
                    a human boy named Sosuke, who gives her the 
                    name Ponyo. Ponyo longs to become human, and 
                    as her friendship with Sosuke grows, she 
                    becomes more humanlike. Ponyo's father brings 
                    her back to their ocean kingdom, but so strong 
                    is Ponyo's wish to live on the surface that she 
                    breaks free, and in the process, spills a 
                    collection of magical elixirs that endanger 
                    Sosuke's village.
