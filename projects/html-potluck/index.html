        </h4>

        <P> 
            In this anime feature, 13-year-old Kiki 
            moves to a seaside town with her talking 
            cat, Jiji, to spend a year alone, in 
            accordance with her village's tradition 
            for witches in training. After learning 
            to control her broomstick, Kiki sets up 
            a flying courier service and soon becomes 
            a fixture in the community. But when the 
            insecure young witch begins questioning 
            herself and loses her magic abilities, 
            she must overcome her self-doubt to get 
            her powers back.

            In this animated feature by noted Japanese director 
            Hayao Miyazaki, 10-year-old Chihiro (Rumi Hiiragi) 
            and her parents (Takashi Nait√¥, Yasuko Sawaguchi) 
            stumble upon a seemingly abandoned amusement park. 
            After her mother and father are turned into giant pigs, 
            Chihiro meets the mysterious Haku (Miyu Irino), who 
            explains that the park is a resort for supernatural 
            beings who need a break from their time spent in the 
            earthly realm, and that she must work there to free 
            herself and her parents.
