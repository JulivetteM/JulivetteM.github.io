                <h1>Final Fantasy XIV</h1>
                <p>
                    <b>Final Fantasy XIV</b>[c] is a massively multiplayer 
                    online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and 
                    published by Square Enix. Directed and produced 
                    by Naoki Yoshida and released worldwide for PlayStation 
                    3 and Windows in August 2013, it replaced the failed 
                    2010 version, with subsequent support for PlayStation 
                    4, macOS, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. Final 
                    Fantasy XIV is set in the fantasy region of Eorzea, 
                    five years after the devastating Seventh Umbral Calamity 
                    which ended the original version. In the Calamity, the 
                    elder primal Bahamut escaped from his prison, an ancient 
                    space station called Dalamud, unleashing an apocalypse 
                    across Eorzea. Through temporal magic, the player 
                    character of the original version escaped, reappearing 
                    at the start of A Realm Reborn. As Eorzea cements its 
                    recovery, the player must fend off a reignited invasion 
                    from the Garlean Empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The original Final Fantasy XIV was a commercial and 
                    critical failure. Then-Square Enix President Yoichi 
                    Wada announced that a new team, led by Yoshida, would 
                    assume control and address the game's flaws. The new 
                    team both continued to develop and improve the original 
                    version, and secretly worked on a completely new 
                    replacement. This new game, codenamed "Version 2.0", used 
                    a new engine, 
                    improved server infrastructure, and revamped gameplay, 
                    interface, and story. The original version shut down in 
                    November 2012, followed by an alpha test for Version 2.0.

                <p>
                    The relaunched game released to largely positive reception; 
                    critics praised its solid mechanics and progression, and 
                    commended Yoshida for an unexpected recovery. After a poor 
                    2013 fiscal year, Square Enix attributed the 2014 return 
                    to profitability partly to the game's strong sales and 
                    subscriber base. By October 2021, it had gained over 24 
                    million registered players and become the most 
                    profitable 
                    Final Fantasy game to date.[1] Final Fantasy XIV has 
                    received 
                    regular updates since release, including five major 
                    expansion 
                    packs: Heavensward (2015), Stormblood (2017), Shadowbringers 
                    (2019), Endwalker (2021), and Dawntrail (2024).

                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Final Fantasy XIV is an MMORPG, featuring a 
                    persistent world where players can interact 
                    with each other and the environment. Players 
                    create and customize their characters for use 
                    in the game, including name, race, gender, facial 
                    features, and starting class. Unlike in the original 
                    release, players may only choose to be a Disciple of 
                    War or Magic as a starting class—Disciples of the 
                    Hand and Land are initially unavailable.[2] Players 
                    must also select a game server for each character. 
                    While all supported languages are available on every 
                    server, data centers are located in specific regions 
                    (i.e., North America, Europe, Japan, and Oceania) to 
                    reduce latency between client and server, and players 
                    are advised to choose a server in their region.[3] 
                    Regardless of server or language, players can use a 
                    large library of automatically translated game terms 
                    and general phrases, allowing players who speak 
                    different languages to communicate.[4]
                </p>
                <h4>Interface</h4>
                <p>
                    PC and home console versions use a unified user 
                    interface (UI) and control scheme allowing for 
                    any combination of keyboard, mouse, and game 
                    controller. On PC, the game defaults to drag and 
                    drop menus, whereas on the console versions, the 
                    default interface resembles the PlayStation 3's 
                    XrossMediaBar.[5] This bar is used to access 
                    menus, maps, logs, and configuration options. 
                    The head-up display for both versions includes 
                    a message log, party status menu, mini-map, and 
                    action bar. The size and location of all UI 
                    elements may be customized.[6]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actions and battle commands differ between PC 
                    and console versions. The PC versions support 
                    both point and click and keyboard input for 
                    commands or macros. Macro commands are 
                    customizable sequences of actions that allow 
                    players to execute desired abilities at a 
                    specific time. The home console versions 
                    instead map the action bar and macros to 
                    the "Cross Hotbar"—sets of four icons arranged 
                    in a cross shape. These are the grouped and 
                    accessed through a combination of the shoulder 
                    buttons and the directional pad or the face buttons. 
                    Using each shoulder button to cycle through the 
                    cross sets, players have quick access to commands. 
                    This interface is also available to PC players who 
                    use controllers.[5]
                </p>

                <h4>Character progression</h4>
                <p>
                    Players improve their characters by gaining 
                    experience points (EXP) and acquiring stronger 
                    equipment. After gaining enough XP, the character 
                    will "level up", improving their statistics, 
                    enhancing the character's performance, and often 
                    learning new actions. Primary sources of experience 
                    points in Final Fantasy XIV include completing quests, 
                    exploring instanced dungeons, participating in Full 
                    Active Time Events (FATEs), and slaying monsters in 
                    the world.[7] Quests, including the "main scenario" 
                    questline, are generally short, specific tasks given 
                    to the player by non-player characters which reward 
                    items and EXP. Completing main scenario quests progresses 
                    the overarching plot of the game. Some quests 
                    are repeatable, 
                    either "daily" quests repeatable each day, or 
                    "Levequests", 
                    which consume "leve allowances" that the player 
                    slowly accrues 
                    over time. Dungeons often require multiple players 
                    to form a 
                    party to enter, but the Duty Support system enables 
                    the player 
                    to play certain dungeons alone, supported by 
                    computer-controlled 
                    party members. Some dungeons are for lower-leveled 
                    players to gain 
                    EXP quickly while others are for experienced players 
                    to collect rare 
                    items, equipment, and currency.[8] The Duty Roulette system 
                    randomly assigns the player to an accessible dungeon, 
                    and once 
                    per day, awards additional bonus EXP scaled to character 
                    level on 
                    completion.[9] FATEs permit large groups of players, 
                    whether or not 
                    they are in a party, to participate in a shared task 
                    in the world. 
                    These location-specific events include battles with 
                    notorious monsters, 
                    defending locations, escorting non-player characters, 
                    culling wildlife, 
                    and assaulting enemy fortresses, among other types.[8] 
                    Finally, each 
                    enemy the player kills provides EXP, with further EXP
                    available from 
                    the Hunting Log, for killing a fixed amount of specific 
                    creatures. 
                    Atb maximum level, character progression focuses entirely on
                    acquiring stronger 
                    equipment, raising the character's "item level". This 
                    equipment can be gained 
                    through a variety of sources including endgame dungeons, 
                    crafting, raids, 
                    primal battles, and elite mark hunts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to these player versus environment 
                    (PvE) challenges, various forms of player versus 
                    player (PvP) combat exist in Final Fantasy XIV. 
                    The Feast was an arena featuring structured 
                    four-versus-four battles where a player could 
                    register with up to three teammates to challenge 
                    another four-person team. This mode was removed in 
                    patch 6.1, when it was replaced with Crystalline 
                    Conflict,[11] which consists of two teams of five 
                    competing to seize control of and push a crystal 
                    which starts at the middle of the arena to each 
                    team's goal point. The second type, Frontlines, 
                    is a large battleground in which players form 
                    teams of up to 24 members. Teams are delineated 
                    by players' allegiance to one of three Grand 
                    Companies and the team which reaches the target 
                    number of points first wins the match. Multiple 
                    modes are available, each with differing locations 
                    and rulesets. Within the game, Frontlines is 
                    presented as an organized set of military exercises 
                    between the three nations with the ulterior goal of 
                    jockeying for dominance of regions rich in magical 
                    artifacts.[12] The third type, Rival Wings, is a 
                    battle arena mode where players manipulate minion 
                    waves and pilot mechs to destroy enemy objectives.
                </p>

                <h4>Battles and party system</h4>
                <p>
                    Players fight enemies using a combination of 
                    physical attacks, weapon skills, and magical 
                    attacks; these battles form the basis of party 
                    play in Final Fantasy XIV. Most battle content 
                    in the game requires parties of a specific size, 
                    including four players for dungeons and eight players 
                    for boss battles. The "Duty Finder" is an automated 
                    matching feature that sorts players into parties for 
                    selected content across different servers.[8] The 
                    "Party Finder" is a bulletin board where players may 
                    recruit players from any server on their data center 
                    for any kind of content including dungeons, raid battles, 
                    FATE parties, and more. Members of a party fill traditional 
                    MMORPG roles like tank, healer, and damage dealer.[13] 
                    Tanks draw the enemy's attention away from other party 
                    members who generally have weaker defense, healers use 
                    restorative abilities and support the party with damage 
                    and enhancing abilities, and damage dealers focus on 
                    attacking the enemy.[14] Teamwork and strategy are required 
                    to defeat the strongest enemies. "Limit Breaks" are special 
                    abilities that can only be performed if members of the party 
                    excel at their roles.[15]
